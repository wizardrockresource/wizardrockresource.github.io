  <p>To explore the Discord, you can browse channels on the side, working from the top downwards. To see what the lyric transcription team are working on, click on UNCLAIMED at the top.</p>
  <p>UNCLAIMED = suggested items for transcribing, CLAIMED = people who have put their hand up to transcribe an item, IN PROGRESS = incomplete transcripts, TROUBLESHOOTING = need feedback. To join the team, claim an item (either your own choice or from the list) by posting a message, or comment on any of the linked docs.</p>
  <p>It SHOULD be possible to post messages either as a guest or while logged in to Discord, but I can't seem to get the latter to work. If you want to post a message, make sure you read the rules of the Discord first (click on "rules" below the Welcome category on the left).</p>
  <p>Lastly, this page is very much a beta project. If this link has been given to you, please do not share it with others or post it anywhere without checking with me first.</p>
